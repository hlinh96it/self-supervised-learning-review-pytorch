In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at self-supervised contrastive learning. Self-supervised learning, or also sometimes called unsupervised learning, describes the scenario where we have given input data, but no accompanying labels to train in a classical supervised way. However, this data still contains a lot of information from which we can learn: how are the images different from each other? What patterns are descriptive for certain images? Can we cluster the images? And so on. Methods for self-supervised learning try to learn as much as possible from the data alone, so it can quickly be finetuned for a specific classification task. 
The benefit of self-supervised learning is that a large dataset can often easily be obtained. For instance, if we want to train a vision model on semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, we can collect large amounts of data by simply installing a camera in a car, and driving through a city for an hour. In contrast, if we would want to do supervised learning, we would have to manually label all those images before training a model. This is extremely expensive, and would likely take a couple of months to manually label the same amount of data. Further, self-supervised learning can provide an alternative to transfer learning from models pretrained on ImageNet since we could pretrain a model on a specific dataset/situation, e.g. traffic scenarios for autonomous driving.

Within the last two years, a lot of new approaches have been proposed for self-supervised learning, in particular for images, that have resulted in great improvements over supervised models when few labels are available. The subfield that we will focus on in this tutorial is contrastive learning. Contrastive learning is motivated by the question mentioned above: how are images different from each other? Specifically, contrastive learning methods train a model to cluster an image and its slightly augmented version in latent space, while the distance to other images should be maximized. A very recent and simple method for this is [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029), which is visualized below (figure credit - [Ting Chen et al.](https://simclr.github.io/)).

The general setup is that we are given a dataset of images without any labels, and want to train a model on this data such that it can quickly adapt to any image recognition task afterward. During each training iteration, we sample a batch of images as usual. For each image, we create two versions by applying data augmentation techniques like cropping, Gaussian noise, blurring, etc. An example of such is shown on the left with the image of the dog. We will go into the details and effects of the chosen augmentation techniques later. On those images, we apply a CNN like ResNet and obtain as output a 1D feature vector on which we apply a small MLP. The output features of the two augmented images are then trained to be close to each other, while all other images in that batch should be as different as possible. This way, the model has to learn to recognize the content of the image that remains unchanged under the data augmentations, such as objects which we usually care about in supervised tasks.

We will now implement this framework ourselves and discuss further details along the way. Let's first start with importing our standard libraries below:
